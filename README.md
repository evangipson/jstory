## Getting Started
If you want a local copy of jStory, just fork the repository, and set this up in a folder somewhere on your computer. After that, run the gulpfile.js to build the JavaScript and the SCSS, then you can use the index.html to view the web page.

You will have to create a new Firebase database and upload new configuration settings in jStory/src/js/db.js if you'd like to detach from the main database.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Google Chrome

## Contributing
Have a look at the [issues with jStory](https://github.com/evangipson/jstory/issues), and create a pull request containing your code so it can be reviewed be merged into the source!

I will run all new javascript through [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) before merging into master.

## Versioning
Chessy is maintained using a 3-digit versioning system, represented by:
```
[Major Version].[Minor Version].[Update]
```
For instance, the first stable build of jStory will be 1.0.0.
